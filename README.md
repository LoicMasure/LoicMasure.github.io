# Loïc Masure

I am a postdoc researcher in the [Crypto group](https://www-crypto.elen.ucl.ac.be/) of [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html) at Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium).


## Research
My research work is mainly devoted to the study of machine learning for profiling attacks in side-channel analysis. You can find more on this in my [thesis manuscript](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03651269). I started this line of research while I was a PhD student into the [ITSEF](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/certification/common-criteria-certification/licensed-itsef/) of [CEA - Leti](https://www.leti-cea.fr/cea-tech/leti), at Grenoble (France).


In particular, I am currently trying to understand to what extent some counter-measures against SCA like [masking]()
